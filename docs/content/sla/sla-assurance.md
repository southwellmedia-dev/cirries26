Beyond Monitoring: Master Your Service Level Agreements
Your Service Level Agreement is more than a contract; it's the promise that defines your reputation. But in today's complex networks, are you truly in control of that promise? Or are you caught in a reactive cycle—waiting for a threshold to be breached, an alarm to ring, and a customer to complain before you can even begin to diagnose the problem?

This reactive approach to SLA management is no longer sustainable. It erodes customer trust and turns your operations team into a constant fire-fighting unit.

Cirries Technologies offers a fundamentally different approach. With DART AI, we transform SLA management from a stressful, reactive exercise into a proactive discipline of service assurance. We don't just help you meet your SLAs; we empower you to master them.

From Reactive Alerts to Proactive Intelligence
The fatal flaw of traditional monitoring is that it tells you you've already failed. DART AI is designed to tell you how to prevent failure.

Our platform's AI engine learns the unique operational heartbeat of your network. It understands what normal performance looks like at the most granular level, allowing it to identify the subtle, leading indicators of a developing problem. Instead of a red alert after a breach, you get a predictive insight, giving you the time and the data needed to resolve an issue before it ever impacts a single user.

The Indisputable Truth of the Packet
An SLA is only as reliable as the data used to measure it. While other tools rely on sampled data or high-level flows, DART provides the ultimate ground truth by analyzing 100% of network packets in real time. This eliminates blind spots and gives you an irrefutable, high-resolution view of the actual user experience, from latency and jitter to application response time. When a problem occurs, the forensic evidence is already captured, allowing for instant root cause analysis.

Turn Your SLA into a Competitive Advantage
When you can move from reacting to problems to proactively guaranteeing performance, your SLA is no longer 
a source of risk. It becomes your most powerful differentiator.
