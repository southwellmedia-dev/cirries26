Delivering on the Promise of Open RAN: Unified Assurance for Private 5G in the Cloud

The future of enterprise connectivity is here: Private 5G networks, built on the flexible, multi-vendor promise of Open RAN and deployed on the immense scale of hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This architecture promises unparalleled agility and innovation.

But this freedom also creates an unprecedented operational challenge. When your network is a collection of disaggregated components from different vendors running on a shared cloud platform, how do you guarantee performance?

Eliminate the Accountability Gap
When a critical application experiences latency, the finger-pointing begins. Is it the Radio Unit (RU) from Vendor A? The Distributed Unit (DU) software from Vendor B? A misconfiguration in the cloud network fabric? Or an issue in the 5G core? Without a single source of truth, your teams are flying blind, and Mean Time to Resolution skyrockets.

Cirries provides that single source of truth. By analyzing 100% of the traffic and metadata flowing between every component, we eliminate the blind spots. Our platform provides the definitive, packet-level proof needed to instantly pinpoint the root cause of any issue, turning a multi-vendor operational nightmare into a clear, manageable ecosystem.

Proactive Assurance for a Disaggregated World
In a dynamic Open RAN environment, you cannot rely on siloed, vendor-specific monitoring tools. You need a holistic intelligence layer that understands how the entire system works together to deliver a service.

DART’s AI engine continuously monitors the performance of every link in the chain—from the RAN to the edge to the cloud core. It proactively detects anomalies, predicts performance degradation, and provides the actionable insights needed to maintain the ultra-low latency and high reliability your mission-critical applications demand.

Realize the True Economic Promise of Open RAN
The strategic goal of Open RAN is to reduce costs and avoid vendor lock-in. But that promise is quickly erased by soaring operational expenses if your teams spend all their time troubleshooting complex integration issues.

By dramatically reducing MTTR and enabling predictive resource optimization, Cirries ensures that your network is not just flexible, but also efficient. We help you lower OPEX and maximize the return on your investment, ensuring your Private 5G network delivers both technological and financial advantages.
Don't let complexity compromise your vision. Ensure your Open RAN investment delivers on its promise.
