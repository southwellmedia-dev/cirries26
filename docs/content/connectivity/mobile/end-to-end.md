The Single Source of Truth for Your Entire Network
In today’s distributed enterprise, your most critical business processes run on a network you can't fully see. When a cloud application slows down or a user complains, the search for answers begins. Your cloud team checks their dashboards. Your network team looks at flow data. Your application team sifts through logs. Each team has a different tool, a different dataset, and a different theory.
This is the reality of modern IT: a collection of data silos that leads to guesswork, finger-pointing, and hours of wasted time in a "war room" trying to find a problem you can't even see.
Cirries ends this chaos by providing the one thing that every team can trust: a single, indisputable source of truth.

The Indisputable Truth of the Packet
Logs, metrics, and flow records are all summaries. They tell you that something happened, but they often hide the why. Packets are different. They are not a summary; they are the original conversation. They are the ground truth of exactly what happened, when it happened, and who was involved.
By capturing and analyzing 100% of packets in real time, Cirries provides an unshakeable foundation of evidence. We create a unified observability layer that correlates data across every device, application, and service—from the user's endpoint to the deepest corners of your cloud.

Go from Symptom to Root Cause in Seconds
With the ground truth at your fingertips, you can transform your operations.
Eliminate Every Blind Spot: Gain full-stack visibility from the physical network transport (L2) all the way up to the application's API calls (L7). See the critical East-West traffic that other tools miss.
Pinpoint the "Why," Not Just the "Where": Stop guessing if it's the network, the application, or the cloud. Our platform shows you the precise point of failure—increased TCP retransmissions, a slow database query, or a misconfigured virtual gateway—with forensic clarity.
Uncover Hidden Threats: Analyze network behavior at the most granular level to detect the subtle anomalies that signal a sophisticated security threat, from lateral movement to data exfiltration.
See It in Action: From Hours of Guesswork to Minutes of Precision
A critical application hosted in AWS is slow, and users are complaining. Traditional tools show healthy infrastructure metrics, and the blame game begins.

With Cirries, the answer is immediate. Packet-level visibility instantly reveals a surge in TCP retransmissions originating from a specific virtual gateway. With a few clicks, the root cause is confirmed: a recent SD-WAN policy update created a suboptimal routing path. The issue is resolved in minutes, not hours or days.

Why Cirries is Different
While other observability platforms rely on sampled data and high-level abstractions, Cirries is built on a foundation of raw, correlated, and enriched packet data. This isn't just more data; it's the right data. It’s the difference between seeing a map of the city and having a real-time GPS navigator for every single vehicle on the road.

As your network evolves with cloud-native apps and private 5G, the need for this granular, real-time intelligence is no longer optional.
Stop searching for answers. Start operating with certainty.
