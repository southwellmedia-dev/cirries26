Private Network Observability: Beyond Connectivity to Guaranteed Performance

In the transformative era of private 5G and dedicated enterprise networks, connectivity is just the beginning. The true measure of success lies in unwavering performance, ironclad reliability, and seamless compliance. For enterprises that depend on private networks for their mission-critical operations, "good enough" isn't good enough. You require certainty.

Cirries' Private Network Observability solution delivers that certainty. We provide the deep, real-time insights and AI-driven automation necessary to ensure your network not only meets but exceeds every service-level agreement (SLA)

From Data Points to Decisive Action
A private network generates a torrent of data. The challenge isn't collecting it, but translating it into meaningful, actionable intelligence—and doing so before minor fluctuations become service-disrupting incidents. Our DART platform was built for this very purpose. By analyzing 100% of network packets in real time, we move beyond surface-level monitoring to provide a complete, multi-layer view of your network's health.

Guarantee Service Levels with Proactive Monitoring: Continuously track critical performance indicators like latency, throughput, and quality of service (QoS) against your defined SLA thresholds. Our platform provides the tools to ensure your business-critical services remain reliable and available.
Anticipate Issues with AI-Powered Insights: The integrated DART AI engine is a game-changer for network management. It intelligently analyzes network traffic to detect subtle deviations and predict potential issues before they impact users. This allows you to shift from a reactive to a proactive operational model, optimizing performance before it degrades.
Accelerate Resolution with Automated Forensics: When an anomaly is detected, our system doesn't just send an alert; it automatically investigates. It collects the relevant forensic data and provides a clear path to resolution, drastically reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and preserving the end-user experience.
Holistic Visibility for a Complex Environment
Private networks are intricate ecosystems, spanning the RAN, core, and edge. Achieving true service level assurance requires a holistic view that correlates data across all these domains. Cirries provides complete visibility into both North-South and East-West traffic, ensuring there are no blind spots where problems can hide. With customizable dashboards and seamless integration into your existing IT and cloud frameworks, you gain a single, unified command center for your entire network.

Deliver a Flawless Private Network Experience
By ensuring service level assurance across your private network, you can minimize downtime, enhance the user experience, and maintain compliance with the most stringent operational standards. Gain the visibility and control you need to guarantee peak performance for your private network.
