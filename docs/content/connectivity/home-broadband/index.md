Stop Getting Blamed for Your Customers' Bad Wi-Fi.

DART-AI gives you visibility and control beyond your network edge, empowering you to proactively diagnose and fix home Wi-Fi issues. Slash support costs, end needless truck rolls, and turn your biggest source of churn into a competitive advantage.

The Problem: The Most Expensive Words in Your Call Center
"My internet is slow."

Your network is running perfectly, but a customer's experience is defined by their Wi-Fi signal, which is blocked by a wall, conflicting with a neighbor's network, or slowed by a 10-year-old router.
You have zero visibility, yet you bear all the costs:
Longer Support Calls: Your agents are flying blind, relying on frustrating, scripted troubleshooting.
Needless Truck Rolls: You dispatch expensive technicians only to find the problem isn't with your service at all.
Customer Churn: Frustrated subscribers, convinced your service is faulty, switch to a competitor.
The home Wi-Fi network has become your responsibility, but you've never had the right tools to manage it. Until now.

The Solution: Visibility and Control Inside the Home
DART-AI is an intelligent platform that extends your visibility directly into the subscriber's home Wi-Fi environment. It analyzes real-time performance data from the home router and connected devices, turning guesswork into data-driven action.

Instead of asking "Have you tried turning it off and on again?", your team can now say "I see you're on a congested Wi-Fi channel. Let me move you to a clearer one."
