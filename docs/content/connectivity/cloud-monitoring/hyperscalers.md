Master Your Hyperscaler Environment: True Observability for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
The move to hyperscale cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud promises unparalleled agility and scalability. But it also introduces a critical challenge: a loss of visibility. Your most vital workloads now run inside a complex, opaque environment where traditional network monitoring tools are blind and native tools only show you part of the picture.

Cirries' DART AI is engineered to restore clarity and control. It provides the deep, packet-level observability you need to master your cloud infrastructure, ensuring performance, security, and cost-efficiency without compromise.

Beyond Native Tools: See What Hyperscalers Hide
Cloud provider tools are useful, but they are designed to keep you within their ecosystem and often leave significant blind spots. The most dangerous of these is East-West traffic—the communication between your own virtual machines, containers, and microservices. This is where modern application issues and security threats hide, and it's almost completely invisible to most monitoring solutions.
DART AI provides complete visibility into 100% of your network traffic, including the critical East-West corridor. This allows you to:
Pinpoint Application Latency: Instantly identify the root cause of performance bottlenecks between services, rather than guessing based on siloed logs.
Uncover Hidden Security Threats: Detect lateral movement and anomalous behavior within your VPC that security groups and flow logs might miss.
Map True Dependencies: Understand exactly how your cloud services interact, simplifying troubleshooting and migration planning.
From Spiraling Costs to Financial Control
One of the biggest surprises of cloud adoption is the bill. Data egress fees, inefficient traffic routing, and over-provisioned resources can lead to runaway operational costs. DART AI provides the intelligence you need to reclaim financial control.

By analyzing traffic patterns in real-time, our platform identifies costly inefficiencies and provides the actionable insights needed to optimize data flow. This allows you to reduce unnecessary data transfer, right-size your instances, and make informed architectural decisions that directly lower your monthly cloud spend.

A Single Source of Truth for a Hybrid World
Few enterprises operate solely in one cloud. DART AI breaks down the data silos between your on-premises data centers and multiple cloud environments. It provides a single, unified view of your entire network, allowing you to monitor performance, enforce security policies, and manage traffic seamlessly across your complete hybrid infrastructure.

As a purely software-based solution, DART AI is built for the cloud era. It scales elastically with your needs, deploying effortlessly without the hardware constraints that make legacy solutions obsolete.
Stop flying blind in the cloud. It's time to transform your hyperscaler environment from a black box into a strategic advantage.
