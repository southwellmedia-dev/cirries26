The Promise of Hybrid Cloud is Agility. The Reality is Operational Chaos.
Your business thrives on a hybrid model, leveraging the control of your private data center and the scale of the public cloud. But when performance suffers, this strategic advantage becomes an operational nightmare.

Your on-prem team sees green lights. Your cloud team insists their environment is healthy. Your SD-WAN provider reports no issues. Each team is looking at a different, siloed tool, and no one can see the complete picture. This is the reality of hybrid IT: a fractured landscape where the most critical problems hide in the gaps between environments.

Cirries DART AI was built to master these gaps. We provide a single, unified layer of observability that unites your entire hybrid estate, transforming operational chaos into absolute clarity.

A Single Source of Truth for a Divided World
The only way to end the blame game is with indisputable evidence. DART AI provides this by analyzing the ground truth of your network: the packets.

Unlike siloed tools that rely on sampled data or high-level logs, we see the entire conversation from end-to-end. We analyze every packet in real-time to generate DART IQ—a rich, cost-efficient metadata layer that gives you the forensic depth of full-packet capture without the crippling expense. This allows you to instantly pinpoint the root cause of any issue, whether it's in your data center, the cloud, or the complex network fabric that connects them.

Master the Seams of Your Hybrid Network
The most fragile part of your hybrid architecture is the connective tissue—the SD-WAN links, VPNs, and direct interconnects. DART AI provides continuous reachability assurance, actively validating these critical paths in real time. We go far beyond simple pings or traceroutes to ensure that when a route changes or a firewall rule is misconfigured, you know instantly—before it can impact a critical service.

Migrate with Certainty, Not Hope
Moving a critical workload to the cloud is a high-stakes decision. Are you truly improving performance, or just shifting the bottleneck? DART AI de-risks your cloud transformation initiatives by providing data-driven benchmarking. We establish a granular performance baseline for your application in its current environment, and then continuously compare it post-migration. This allows you to validate improvements, troubleshoot regressions, and make confident decisions based on facts, not assumptions.
Your hybrid cloud should be a strategic advantage, not an operational burden. It's time to stop managing silos and start operating a single, cohesive, and intelligent environment.
