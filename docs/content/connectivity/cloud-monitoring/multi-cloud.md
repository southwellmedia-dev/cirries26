The End of the Multi-Cloud War Room

Your enterprise runs on a strategic mix of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and your own data centers. But when a critical application's performance degrades, the war room assembles, and the finger-pointing begins.

Your cloud teams see healthy metrics in their native tools. Your network team insists the connections are solid. Your application team is certain it's an infrastructure problem. Each team is looking at a different dashboard, a different dataset, and a different version of reality. Meanwhile, your business suffers.
This is the hidden tax of multi-cloud: operational chaos. Cirries DART AI provides the one thing that can end it: a single, indisputable source of truth for your entire hybrid estate.

Unified Truth, Not Just Unified Data
DART AI is not another dashboard that simply aggregates disconnected data. It creates a unified intelligence layer by analyzing the ground truth: the packets. By seeing the actual conversations between applications and infrastructure—no matter where they are—we provide a definitive, end-to-end view of performance. This allows you to:
Eliminate Every Blind Spot: We analyze every flow and generate DART IQ—a rich, efficient metadata layer derived from packets. This gives you the granular intelligence of full-packet capture without the crippling cost and complexity, illuminating the critical East-West traffic that cloud-native tools miss.
Master the Gaps Between Clouds: The most fragile part of your multi-cloud architecture isn't inside a VPC; it's the space between them. DART continuously validates reachability from cloud-to-cloud, region-to-region, and edge-to-cloud, instantly identifying where a routing shift, policy conflict, or misconfiguration has broken the chain.
Migrate, Modernize, and Operate with Confidence
A multi-cloud strategy requires making high-stakes decisions. DART AI provides the data you need to make them with certainty. Before migrating a workload, you can establish detailed performance benchmarks and, after the move, validate that performance has improved. This de-risks your transformation initiatives and ensures you're realizing the full value of each cloud provider.

From Diagnosis to Autonomous Action
At multi-cloud scale, human-led troubleshooting is too slow. DART's AI engine moves beyond diagnosis to drive action. It detects anomalies that span multiple providers, correlates events that siloed tools can't connect, and generates clear, natural-language summaries of complex incidents. This not only accelerates Mean Time to Resolution but paves the way for a future of autonomous multi-cloud operations.
