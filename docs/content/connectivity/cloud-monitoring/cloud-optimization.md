Cloud Optimization with Cirries: Tame the Chaos of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud
Your cloud strategy has evolved. You leverage the power of hyperscalers like AWS and Azure, the control of your private cloud, and the reliability of your on-premises data center. But while your infrastructure has become a sophisticated, distributed ecosystem, your visibility tools likely have not. You're left with a patchwork of disparate dashboards, data silos, and a constant, nagging question: where is the single source of truth?

Cirries Technologies provides that truth. We deliver a unified observability and optimization platform built for the complex reality of your hybrid world, transforming operational chaos into strategic clarity.

A Single Source of Truth for a Fractured Environment
The moment an application slows down, the finger-pointing begins. Is it the public cloud provider? The on-prem network? The code? DART AI eliminates the guesswork by providing one consistent, 
packet-level view across your entire estate—AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, and bare-metal servers alike. 

By breaking down the silos between your CloudOps, DevOps, and NetOps teams, you can stop arguing over whose fault it is and start solving problems collaboratively and instantly.

From Reactive Alarms to Proactive Optimization
Monitoring isn't enough when you're managing multiple environments. You need a platform that works to actively improve performance and efficiency. Cirries goes beyond alerts by using a powerful AI engine to continuously optimize your cloud infrastructure.
Slash Cloud Costs: Our platform intelligently analyzes traffic patterns to identify and eliminate inefficiencies. By optimizing data routing and predicting bandwidth needs, we help you reduce costly egress fees and avoid over-provisioning.
Guarantee Performance: DART’s predictive analytics anticipate congestion and potential SLA violations. It can proactively re-route traffic or recommend workload balancing to prevent performance degradation before your users are ever affected.
See Inside the Black Box of the Cloud
Whether it's communication between containers in a Kubernetes cluster or traffic between VMs in your private cloud, the most critical performance and security issues live in the East-West corridor. This traffic is a black box to most monitoring tools. Cirries illuminates it completely, providing deep insight into the internal workings of your cloud, allowing you to find the hidden bottlenecks and security risks that others 
miss.

With a cloud-agnostic architecture that adapts to your environment, Cirries delivers a consistent, powerful layer of intelligence no matter how complex your strategy becomes.

Cloud performance is no longer a black box—it’s your competitive advantage.
