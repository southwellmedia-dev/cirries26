Fulfill the Promise of Your Private Cloud: Absolute Control and Predictive Assurance
You chose a private cloud for a reason: to gain ultimate control, ensure ironclad security, and deliver guaranteed performance for your most critical workloads. But as your environment scales, that promised control can be lost to complexity. Virtualized layers, software-defined networking, and distributed applications create blind spots, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint the true source of a performance issue.

Cirries' DART AI is engineered to restore that control. We provide the deep, end-to-end observability and predictive intelligence needed to master your private cloud, ensuring it operates as the secure, high-performance asset it was designed to be.

See Everything, From the Underlay to the Application
The biggest challenge in a private cloud isn't a lack of data; it's the inability to connect the dots. DART eliminates the silos between your infrastructure and the applications it supports, providing a single, unified view of your entire stack.
Illuminate East-West Traffic: We provide granular, packet-level visibility into the traffic moving between your virtual machines and containers. This is where modern application problems and security threats hide, and it's a critical blind spot for most monitoring tools.
End the Blame Game: When an application is slow, is it the network, storage, compute, or the application code? DART correlates performance data across all layers, instantly identifying the root cause and ending the time-consuming hunt for answers.
Move from Reactive Operations to Proactive Assurance
In a private cloud, "good enough" performance isn't good enough. You need to proactively meet stringent SLAs and ensure a flawless user experience. DART’s AI engine transforms your operations from a reactive fire-drill to a proactive model of assurance.

Our platform uses advanced machine learning to understand the unique heartbeat of your environment, detecting subtle anomalies that signal future trouble. When an issue is identified, our Agentic AI can trigger closed-loop remediation workflows to restore performance automatically, often before your users are ever impacted.

Maximize the Return on Your Private Cloud Investment

A private cloud is a significant investment. DART AI helps you maximize its value by:
Guaranteeing Performance: Ensure your mission-critical enterprise workloads always meet strict performance and regulatory requirements.
Reducing Operational Costs: Eliminate costly downtime and drastically reduce the hours your team spends on manual troubleshooting.
Strengthening Compliance: Maintain complete visibility for sensitive workloads, providing the audit trails needed to satisfy any compliance framework.
