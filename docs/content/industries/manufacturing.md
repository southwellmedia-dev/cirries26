DART Helps Optimize 5G Manufacturing Networks
Nowhere is the power of 5G network connectivity likely to be more far reaching than the factory floor. For example, current automotive production is about 50 percent efficient, according to Tech Mahindra. 5G applications will raise that rate in the automotive and other sectors, too.
5G enabled manufacturing makes possible processes that are intelligent, linked at ultra-high speed, and digitized. It will lower downtime associated with traditional asset management and reduce quality errors due to manual inspection and by-hand order collection.

5G technologies will make wireless factory networks far more reliable, secure, and much easier and quicker to set up, move, or rearrange with shifting needs. 5G can handle far larger amounts of attached devices like sensors or robots without degrading network performance, too.

With 5G only just rolling out, enterprises are deciding how to fit it into their factories. Most organizations are likely to operate some blend of 5G and earlier technologies in their manufacturing networks for some time.

Due to the complexities of 5G, comprehensive network performance monitoring is no longer an option or afterthought. And, no matter where your manufacturing operations are on their 5G journey, you need data analysis in real time (DART).

Entirely virtual, DART consists of unique, next-gen network tools for monitoring, securing, and traffic engineering the 5G network. DART helps organizations optimize and maintain a network that makes possible top manufacturing quality, cost-savings, and production efficiencies.

DART helps maximize network uptime and overall network functions. DART also evolves continually, eliminating any chance of future hardware obsolescence.
