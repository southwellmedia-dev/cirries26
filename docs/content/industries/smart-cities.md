DART Supports Critical Public Sector 5G Connectivity
There has been lots of chatter about “smart” cities. With the arrival of 5G technologies, talk turns into reality. 5G networks and edge computing with analytics have the power to transform public sector infrastructure. Functions like street lighting, water and wastewater management, traffic flow, emergency response and public safety measures can all be vastly improved using 5G technologies.
As just one example, cities for years have been replacing incandescent traffic signal and street lights with LED bulbs to save energy costs. But the real change will happen when all those LED lights are linked by high speed 5G networks and equipped with connected sensors.

Change like real-time and historic traffic pattern analysis, or immediate allocation of emergency personnel and equipment to accidents that are seen and located as they happen. And much more.

5G will make public sector networks far more reliable, secure, and much easier and quicker to set up, move, or rearrange. 5G can handle far larger amounts of attached devices like sensors or cell phones without degrading network performance, too.

With 5G just rolling out, cities are deciding how to fit it into their operations and budgets. Most municipalities are likely to operate earlier technologies with some 5G advancements in their networks for some time.

Due to the complexities of 5G, comprehensive network performance monitoring is no longer an option or afterthought, even in the public sector. And, no matter where your city is on its 5G journey, you need data analysis in real time (DART) to attain and maintain network excellence.

Entirely virtual, DART consists of unique, next-gen network tools for monitoring, securing, and traffic engineering the 5G network. DART helps organizations optimize and maintain a network that makes possible top manufacturing quality, cost-savings, and production efficiencies.

DART helps maximize network uptime and overall network functions. DART also evolves continually, eliminating any chance of future hardware obsolescence.
