##Cirries Technologies Announces DART AI Integration with Amazon Bedrock, Pioneering AI-Driven Alert Analysis and Resolution

September 16, 2024 Richardson, TX: Cirries Technologies, a leader in network observability and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven network management, is delighted to announce its innovative DART AI (Data Analysis Real Time AI) integration with Amazon Bedrock. This new offering is also now available in AWS Marketplace, which marks a significant milestone in the realm of automated network alert management and resolution. AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Revolutionizing Network Observability with Amazon Bedrock

The integration of DART AI with Amazon Bedrock represents a leap forward in how networks are monitored and managed. This new offering leverages generative AI foundation models (FMs) within Amazon Bedrock to enhance DART AI’s capabilities in real-time alert analysis and resolution, setting new standards for efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in network management. 
 
Key Features of the Integration

The integration of DART AI with Amazon Bedrock brings several significant enhancements to network management capabilities. First, it offers enhanced alert analysis by leveraging Amazon Bedrock’s advanced AI models, allowing DART AI to provide deeper insights into network anomalies. This results in more accurate and context-aware alert prioritization and resolution strategies, enabling network managers to address issues more effectively before they escalate. The integration also ensures scalable AI operations, allowing DART AI to handle increased alert volumes seamlessly without compromising performance, which is crucial for managing large-scale networks or during peak operational times.

Additionally, the integration empowers DART AI with automated resolution capabilities. Utilizing Amazon Bedrock’s generative AI FMs, DART AI can not only analyze network alerts but also suggest or automatically implement resolution steps, significantly reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and enhancing overall network reliability. Moreover, the integration benefits from AWS’s robust security framework, ensuring that all data processed through DART AI is secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations, which is essential for managing sensitive network operations.

Industry Impact

Cody Martinson, COO at Cirries Technologies, stated, “This integration with Amazon Bedrock is not just an enhancement; it’s a transformation. It positions DART AI at the forefront of AI-driven network management, offering our clients unparalleled capabilities in managing their network environments autonomously and efficiently.”

Looking Ahead

Cirries Technologies continues to innovate, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in network management. The integration with Amazon Bedrock is a testament to Cirries’ commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology for solving real-world network challenges.
