Anomaly Detection: Achieve Certainty with AI-Powered Network Defense
In today's borderless network, traditional security tools are failing. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and SIEMs generate a tsunami of alerts, leaving security teams struggling to find the real threats in a sea of noise. Meanwhile, sophisticated attackers exploit the biggest blind spot in your infrastructure: the East-West traffic moving between your own servers and applications.

Cirries redefines network defense by moving beyond alerts to deliver certainty. Our DART AI platform provides the ground truth of what is actually happening on your network. By analyzing 100% of packet data in real time, we empower you to detect the subtle, sophisticated threats that other tools miss entirely.

Learning the Heartbeat of Your Network
At the core of our platform is an AI engine that doesn't rely on static signatures or outdated rules. It first learns the unique operational rhythm—the "heartbeat"—of your network. It understands which users, devices, and applications should be communicating, when, and how.

The Foundation for a True Zero-Trust Strategy
A zero-trust architecture is built on the principle of "never trust, always verify." But you cannot verify what you cannot see. Cirries provides the essential observability layer needed to make zero-trust a reality.
By providing continuous, packet-level visibility into every session, we enable you to:
Continuously Verify Traffic: Ensure that all network communications adhere to your least-privilege access policies.
Accelerate Microsegmentation: Understand true application dependencies to build and enforce effective microsegmentation policies without breaking critical workflows.
Secure Encrypted Traffic: Analyze traffic behavior and metadata to detect threats even within encrypted tunnels, preserving both security and privacy.
A Single Source of Truth for Security and Operations
Cirries breaks down the silos between your NetOps and SecOps teams. Our platform provides a single, unified view of network performance and security, allowing for faster, more collaborative incident response. When a threat is detected, you have the definitive packet-level forensics at your fingertips to understand the root cause, scope the impact, and resolve it with speed and precision.

Stop chasing alerts. Start defending your network with intelligent, proactive certainty.
