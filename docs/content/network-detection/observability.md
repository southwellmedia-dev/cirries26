A Network That Thinks: Intelligent Network Observability with Cirries
In the face of overwhelming network complexity, simple machine learning and basic alerts are no longer enough. They add to the noise, creating a flood of data without context or clear direction. To truly master the modern network, you need more than monitoring; you need a system that can understand, reason, act, and communicate.

Cirries delivers this with a multi-layered intelligence engine that functions like a complete cognitive system for your network, combining four distinct but interconnected forms of AI.

1. The Foundation: Understanding with an Ontology Stack
Before you can identify what's wrong, you must first understand what is. At the core of our platform is a powerful Ontology Stack. This isn't just a database; it's a dynamic map of your entire environment. It builds a rich, contextual model of every device, service, application, and user, and crucially, understands the intricate relationships between them. 

2. The Watchtower: Predicting with Machine Learning
With this deep context in place, our Machine Learning (ML) models go to work. Trained on your network’s unique patterns, our ML engine continuously analyzes millions of real-time data points to detect the subtlest deviations from the norm. It moves beyond simple threshold-based alerts to identify complex anomalies and, more importantly, predict performance degradation and potential SLA breaches before they can impact your business.

3. The First Responder: Acting with Agentic AI
When an issue is identified and understood, what happens next? This is where Agentic AI transforms observability into action. Our intelligent agents are empowered to act autonomously, with a single goal: to maintain your defined performance, security, and business objectives. They can independently diagnose root causes across the most complex hybrid environments and trigger automated remediation—rerouting traffic, isolating a threat, or reallocating resources—without waiting for human intervention.

4. The Translator: Communicating with Generative AI
Finally, our Generative AI layer closes the loop between the network and its human operators. It translates complex technical events and automated actions into clear, human-readable narratives. Instead of a cryptic alert, your team receives an intelligent summary explaining what happened, why it happened, the business impact, and what was done to resolve it. It can even simulate potential fixes and their outcomes, turning every event into a learning opportunity.

The Cirries Advantage: A System That Understands
By layering these four intelligences, Cirries delivers a platform that doesn’t just see your network—it understands it. It anticipates challenges, acts decisively, and communicates with clarity. This is the future of the autonomous network.
