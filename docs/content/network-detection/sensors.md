Clarity at the Speed of 5G: The Power of DART Sensors
The promise of 5G is one of transformation—a fully virtualized environment delivering ultra-low latency and unprecedented speed. But for network operators, this power is also the greatest operational challenge. At 5G speeds, problems occur in microseconds, and by the time you've manually detected an issue, the impact is already widespread.

In this high-velocity environment, the only source of ground truth is the data itself—the raw packets and rich metadata flowing through the network core. You cannot manage what you cannot see, and traditional probes simply cannot keep up.

Purpose-Built for the Demands of 5G
DART Sensors are engineered to be the hyper-aware eyes and ears of your 5G network. They are more than just data collectors; they are high-performance instruments designed to capture every detail with perfect fidelity, providing the raw intelligence needed for true observability. By tapping directly into the network fabric, our sensors capture both the granular detail of raw packets—the richest source for analysis—and the broad context of 5G metadata.

Taming the 5G Data Deluge
Capturing this data is only half the battle. The sheer volume of packets and metadata in a 5G network can create more noise than signal, overwhelming legacy systems and human operators alike. This is where the intelligence of the DART platform begins.

Our sensors are engineered not just to capture data, but to process it at incredible scale, acting as the first line of intelligent filtering and summarization.
Unprecedented Throughput: DART sensors are capable of handling line rates up to 100 Gbps on specialized hardware and 10 Gbps per virtual instance, ensuring no packet is ever missed.
Massive Scale Processing: Each metadata sensor can process and summarize millions of flow records per second, alongside Syslog, SNMP, and other data, distilling the torrent of information into a clean, high-fidelity stream for our AI engine.
For 5G operators, comprehensive network observability is no longer a luxury; it is the foundation of excellence. DART Sensors provide the crucial, high-fidelity input our AI engine needs to turn the chaos of 5G data into the clarity you need to deliver on its promise.
