##Detecting the Undetectable: How Cirries DART Unifies Performance and Security Anomaly Detection

Date

In today’s hyper-connected world, network performance and security are no longer separate conversations. A jittery connection could be a failing switch—or a precursor to a cyberattack. Packet loss might point to poor routing—or data exfiltration in progress. Enterprises need a way to detect anomalies at the intersection of performance and security—in real time and with actionable clarity.

Cirries DART makes that possible.

Performance and Security: Two Sides of the Same Coin
Modern networks are complex, distributed, and dynamic. With multi-cloud, edge, IoT, and mobile traffic surging, the attack surface is expanding—and so are the blind spots. Traditional tools struggle to keep up. They silo performance monitoring and security analytics, leaving gaps in visibility and delays in response.Cirries DART changes the game by fusing packet-level observability with AI-driven anomaly detection, enabling you to catch both performance degradations and security threats—often before users notice or damage occurs.

Real-Time Anomaly Detection, Rooted in Packets

At the core of Cirries DART is real-time packet ingestion and analytics. Unlike tools that rely on sampled flow data or aggregated logs, DART analyzes every packet, giving you a complete and continuous picture of your network.

This granular data powers advanced Machine Learning algorithms that:

Identify deviations from expected baselines—whether caused by misconfigurations, software bugs, or malicious activity
Detect unusual latency patterns or throughput degradation
Correlate behavior across devices, locations, and time windows
Unified Detection: When Performance and Security Collide

Here’s where DART stands apart: it doesn’t just flag anomalies. It understands their impact and context. That means a security alert isn’t just a spike in port scans—it’s tied to a sudden drop in VoIP quality. A routing loop doesn’t just increase latency—it aligns with suspicious DNS tunneling.

This holistic view allows teams to:

Accelerate Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
Prioritize anomalies based on business and user impact
Close the gap between NetOps and SecOps workflows
AI-Driven Insights and Automation

DART doesn’t just identify issues—it learns from your network. Its adaptive models continuously refine baselines, reducing false positives and surfacing truly novel behavior. Combined with policy-driven automation, DART enables:

Autonomous alert suppression for known noise
Auto-remediation of performance issues (e.g., rerouting traffic, rebalancing loads)
Triggering of security playbooks or threat hunting workflows
Use Case Spotlight
A global enterprise using Cirries DART detected a burst of DNS queries from a remote office—seemingly harmless. But DART correlated it with elevated CPU load on core routers and an unusual spike in east-west traffic. The result? Early identification of a data exfiltration attempt using DNS tunneling, stopped before any breach occurred.

Why Cirries DART?

Packet-level granularity for deep visibility
AI + ML anomaly detection across performance and security vectors
Real-time analytics for proactive decision-making
End-to-end observability from cloud to edge
Open APIs and integrations with SIEMs, NDRs, and orchestration tools.
Conclusion
In an environment where performance issues can mask security threats, and security breaches can trigger performance degradation, Cirries DART offers a unified approach to anomaly detection that’s built for modern networks.
