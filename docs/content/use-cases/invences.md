Enhancing User Experience for a Network Operator with DART AI
 
Overview
A national network operator, providing services to millions of users, faces challenges in maintaining consistent service quality across its extensive hybrid and 5G network infrastructure. The operator aims to improve user experience by reducing network disruptions and enhancing performance metrics like latency and data throughput.
 
 
Customer Testimonial
"Our customers demanded a comprehensive network observability platform that not only tracks multiple network elements but also correlates packet data with these elements to detect anomalies. The Cirries DART AI platform delivers this capability, using AI to drive resolutions that significantly reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and network downtime."
- CTO of company.
 
Challenge
With the increase in data-intensive applications and IoT devices, the operator experiences spikes in network usage, leading to congestion, higher latency, and occasional service outages. Frequent customer complaints about slow data speeds, dropped calls, and poor video streaming quality, especially during peak usage times. The traditional network monitoring solutions are not equipped to handle the complexity and scale of modern 5G networks, leading to reactive rather than proactive management.
 
Solution
The network operator decided to leverage DART AI from Cirries Technologies to transform its network operations. It provides deep insights into network behavior, identifying bottlenecks and anomalies in real time and monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) like latency, jitter, and packet loss continuously, ensuring immediate detection of service degradation.
 
DART AI not only detect but also diagnose and suggest or implement fixes for network issues, reducing the time from detection to resolution and predicts potential network issues based on usage patterns and historical data, allowing for preventive actions before users are affected.
 
Implementation Process
DART AI is integrated into the operator's existing network infrastructure with minimal disruption, utilizing its cloud-based, plug-and-play capabilities.  Network engineers and IT staff are trained on interpreting AI-generated insights and using the system's automated tools for better network management.  DART AI was initially deployed in a high-traffic urban area to test effectiveness before a full-scale rollout across the network.
 
Results & Benefits
•   	≥ 50% reduction in latency-related complaints, ensuring smoother streaming, faster data transfer, and better call quality.
•   	Packet loss decreased by 30%, leading to more stable connections even during peak loads.
•   	Manual troubleshooting efforts reduced by 70%, allowing the IT team to focus on strategic initiatives rather than firefighting network issues.
•   	Continuous network optimization based on real-time data, leading to an overall uplift in service quality and customer satisfaction.
