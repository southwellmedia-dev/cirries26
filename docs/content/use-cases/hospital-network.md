Use Case: Hospital Network Enhancement with DART AI
 
Overview
A leading hospital, aiming to leverage technology for better patient care, is dealing with network inefficiencies in its digital health systems. The hospital's network supports critical applications like electronic health records (EHR), telemedicine, and IoT medical devices. Persistent network issues like latency, jitter, and packet loss have been affecting these services, leading to delays in patient care and operational inefficiencies.
 
Customer Testimonial
“The Cirries DART AI product has been a game changer for our network performance. In our trial deployment on the network, we saw an immediate improvement in network visibility and proactive issue resolution. The AI-driven insights allowed us to identify and address anomalies in real-time, resulting in increased network uptime and enhanced operational efficiency. The integration of DART AI with our existing infrastructure was seamless, and its predictive analytics that helped us discover network potential outages before they could impact our services. We are extremely impressed with the depth of data insights. DART AI provides and the measurable improvements it delivered for our network.”

Challenge
·  	Achieving excellent Network Performance which is crucial for telehealth consultations and monitoring of patient vitals via IoT devices.
·  	Proactive monitoring not available with traditional network management tools that do not provide real-time insights or predictive analytics, leading to reactive rather than proactive maintenance.
·  	Reducing operational downtime by automatically pinpointing the root cause of anomalies reducing troubleshooting periods which reduces staff efficiency.
 
Solution
The hospital decides to implement DART AI by Cirries Technologies to address these challenges because it provides AI-Driven Network Observability provides comprehensive visibility into network health, identifying anomalies as they occur and continuously monitors network performance metrics like latency, jitter, and packet loss, offering real-time data processing for immediate action.
 
It then utilizes AI to pinpoint the exact causes of network issues, automating what would otherwise be a manual, time-consuming process. The system not only fixes current issues but also predicts potential future problems, mitigating them before they impact operations.
 
Implementation Process
DART AI integrates with the hospital's existing network infrastructure with minimal disruption, thanks to its plug-and-play design. Staff receive brief training to understand system alerts and automated responses, ensuring they can leverage DART AI effectively. Implementation starts with critical areas like the ICU and operation theaters before expanding hospital wide.
