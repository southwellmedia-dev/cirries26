Medical Device and Services Company Enhances Network Reliability
Overview
DART AI is monitoring the network between the remotely controlled operating theater robots and the applications residing in the cloud.  The network is a private 5G environment. DART AI ensures that the KPI’s are met between the operating theater and the cloud by identifying problems in the network as they happen and provide a fix.  This reduces the Mean-Time-To-Repair and maintains the required SLAs. 
DART AI is Cirries next generation network observability product with automation and AI.
