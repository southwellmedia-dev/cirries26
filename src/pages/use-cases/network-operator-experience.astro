  <CaseStudyChallenge
    title="The Challenge"
    pullQuote="Traditional network monitoring solutions are not equipped to handle the complexity and scale of modern 5G networks, leading to reactive rather than proactive management."
    description="With the increase in data-intensive applications and IoT devices, the operator experienced spikes in network usage, leading to congestion, higher latency, and occasional service outages. Frequent customer complaints about slow data speeds, dropped calls, and poor video streaming quality were affecting customer satisfaction."

  <!-- Solution Section -->
  <CaseStudySolution
    title="The Solution"
    solutionText="The network operator decided to leverage DART AI from Cirries Technologies to transform its network operations. DART AI not only detects but also diagnoses and suggests or implements fixes for network issues, reducing the time from detection to resolution. It predicts potential network issues based on usage patterns and historical data, allowing for preventive actions before users are affected."
    implementationTitle="Implementation Process"
    implementationText="DART AI was integrated into the operator's existing network infrastructure with minimal disruption, utilizing its cloud-based, plug-and-play capabilities. Network engineers and IT staff were trained on interpreting AI-generated insights and using the system's automated tools. DART AI was initially deployed in a high-traffic urban area to test effectiveness before a full-scale rollout across the network."
